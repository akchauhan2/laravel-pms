# Project Overview, Aim, Objective, and Reason for Selection

## Project Explanation
This Laravel-based Project Management System (PMS) is designed to streamline and automate the management of projects, tasks, bugs, and team collaboration for organizations or student teams. It provides a RESTful API backend that can be used by web or mobile clients to interact with the system.

## Main Aim
- To create a robust, scalable, and secure backend system for managing projects, tasks, bug tickets, discussions, and notifications.
- To enable efficient collaboration among team members and ensure timely completion of project milestones.

## Objectives
- Provide CRUD operations for projects, tasks, bugs, and discussions.
- Implement user authentication and role-based access control for secure data management.
- Facilitate team communication and notifications for deadlines and updates.
- Ensure data integrity and easy database management using migrations and Eloquent ORM.
- Support future scalability and integration with other platforms (e.g., mobile apps, third-party tools).

## Reason for Selecting the Project
- Project management is a critical need in both academic and professional environments, making this system highly relevant and practical.
- Laravel offers rapid development, built-in security, and a modular structure, making it ideal for building scalable APIs.
- The project provides hands-on experience with modern web development practices, RESTful APIs, database migrations, and automated testing.
- It demonstrates the ability to solve real-world problems and prepares for future work in software development, team collaboration, and system integration.

# Viva Preparation Guide for Laravel PMS

## 1. Future Scope of the Project

### a. Scalability & User Support
- **Expand support for users:**
  - Implement multi-tenancy to allow multiple organizations to use the same system.
  - Add user groups, teams, and hierarchical structures.
  - Use caching and database optimization for handling large user bases.

### b. Advanced Permissions & Granular Roles
- **Advanced permissions:**
  - Role-based access control (RBAC): Define roles like Admin, Manager, Developer, Tester, etc.
  - Permission matrix: Assign specific permissions to roles (e.g., can edit tasks, can view bugs, can delete projects).
  - Granular roles: Allow custom roles with fine-grained permissions (e.g., only view, only comment, only assign).

### c. Workflow Automation
- **Workflow automation:**
  - Automate notifications for deadlines, status changes, or new assignments.
  - Integrate with tools like Slack, email, or calendar for reminders.
  - Use Laravel Queues for background jobs (e.g., sending bulk emails, generating reports).

### d. Integration & Mobile Support
- **Integration:**
  - Connect with third-party APIs for analytics, reporting, or communication.
- **Mobile App:**
  - Use the existing API for mobile app development (Android/iOS).

### e. AI/ML Enhancements
- Predict project delays, recommend task assignments, or auto-prioritize bugs using machine learning.

## 2. Weak and Strong Points

### a. Strong Points
- **Modular Structure:**
  - Code is organized into Models, Controllers, Requests, etc., making it maintainable and scalable.
- **RESTful API:**
  - Clean separation between backend and frontend/mobile clients.
- **Laravel Features Used:**
  - Authentication, migrations, notifications, Eloquent ORM, middleware.
- **Database Migrations:**
  - Version control for database schema, easy setup and rollback.

### b. Weak Points & Rectification
- **Weak Points:**
  - Limited error handling/logging.
  - Basic test coverage.
  - No frontend (if only API is used).
  - May not be optimized for high concurrency.

- **How to Rectify:**
  - Implement advanced logging (Laravel Monolog, Sentry).
  - Add more unit and feature tests (PHPUnit, Laravel Test).
  - Use Laravel Horizon for queue monitoring and optimization.
  - Add frontend using Vue.js, React, or Blade templates.
  - Optimize queries and use caching (Redis, Memcached).

## 3. About the Modules

- **User Management:** Registration, authentication, roles, permissions.
- **Project Management:** CRUD for projects, assign users, set deadlines.
- **Task Management:** Create/update tasks, assign users, set status.
- **Bug Tracking:** Report and track bugs/tickets.
- **Discussion:** Team communication, comments.
- **Notifications:** Alerts for deadlines, updates.

---

## 4. SQL Commands Used

- **Migrations:**
  - `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE` via Laravel migrations.
- **CRUD Operations:**
  - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` via Eloquent ORM.
- **Joins:**
  - Used for relationships (e.g., users assigned to projects/tasks).
- **Indexes:**
  - Primary keys, foreign keys for data integrity and performance.

---

## 5. Test Cases

### a. Unit Tests
- **Coverage:**
  - Model validation, business logic, relationships.
- **Approach:**
  - Test each modelâ€™s methods and relationships.
  - Use factories to generate test data.

### b. Feature Tests
- **Coverage:**
  - API endpoints (e.g., create project, update task).
  - Authentication and authorization.
- **Approach:**
  - Simulate HTTP requests and assert responses.
  - Test edge cases (invalid data, unauthorized access).

---

## 6. Tables

- `users`: User info.
- `projects`: Project details.
- `tasks`: Tasks within projects.
- `bug_tickets`: Bug reports.
- `discussions`: Comments/messages.
- `personal_access_tokens`: API authentication.
- Additional: password resets, failed jobs, notifications, etc.

---

## 7. Modular Structure in Laravel

- **Models:** Represent database tables and business logic.
- **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests, process input, return responses.
- **Requests:** Validate incoming data before it reaches controllers.
- **Middleware:** Filter HTTP requests (authentication, logging).
- **Notifications:** Send alerts via email, SMS, etc.
- **Providers:** Register services and bindings in the app.

---

## 8. Laravel Features (Used & Others)

- **Used:**
  - Authentication, migrations, Eloquent ORM, notifications, middleware.
- **Other Useful Features:**
  - Queues, events, broadcasting, caching, task scheduling, policies, gates, file storage, API resources.

---

## 9. Database Migration: What & How

- **What is Migration?**
  - Version control for database schema. Allows you to create, modify, and share database structure easily.

- **Steps Used in Application:**
  1. Create migration file: `php artisan make:migration create_projects_table`
  2. Define schema in migration file (fields, keys).
  3. Run migration: `php artisan migrate`
  4. Rollback if needed: `php artisan migrate:rollback`
  5. Seed data: `php artisan db:seed`

---

## 10. Eloquent ORM: What & Why

- **What is Eloquent ORM?**
  - Object Relational Mapper for Laravel. Allows you to interact with the database using PHP objects instead of raw SQL.

- **Why Use Eloquent?**
  - Simplifies database operations.
  - Handles relationships (hasMany, belongsTo, etc.).
  - Built-in query builder, easy to use and maintain.
  - Security (prevents SQL injection).

## 11. Additional Common Viva Questions

- **Why Laravel?**
  - Rapid development, built-in features, security, scalability.
- **How is security handled?**
  - Authentication, authorization, validation, CSRF protection.
- **How are relationships managed?**
  - Eloquent ORM (hasMany, belongsTo, etc.).
- **How is data validated?**
  - Request classes and validation rules.
- **How to optimize performance?**
  - Caching, query optimization, queue management.
- **How to handle errors?**
